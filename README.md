# Drop

<img src="/docs/logo.png" align="right"></img>
Minimalistic, hybrid MVC / IoC micro-architecture framework for ActionScript on Apache Flex and AIR platforms.

Drop derives from PureMVC and aims to minimize implementation approach discordance, forcing to write bug-safe and consistent solutions with less boilerplate code, also introducing typed notification model and strong notion of *Separation of Concerns* concept.

Hybrid framework features:
* Inversion of Control micro-architecture based on ServiceLocator, called `Context`;
* Model / View / Controller tiers coded in `Services` / `Mediators` / `Controller` classes respectively;
* Strongly-typed notification & delegation model based on Actor Interfaces.
