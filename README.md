# Drop

Minimalistic, hybrid MVC / IoC microarchitecture framework for ActionScript and Apache Flex.

Drop derives from PureMVC and aims to minimize implementation approach discordance, forcing to write less boilerplate, less bug-prone and more consistent code, also introducing typed notification model and strong notion of Separation of Concerns concept.

Hybrid framework nature features:
* Inversion of Control microarchitecture based on ServiceLocator, called Context;
* Model / View / Controller tiers coded in Services / Mediators / BusinessController classes respectively;
* Strongly-typed notification & delegation model based on interfaces.
